### To run the server in a container you can simply download the makefile in /server-c and run it with make
### The client is already compiled so you can just run the binary file, like this ./client.out

### (Note) You need to have the docker engine installed in your system, you can use https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ as a guide for your distro or OS installation.
